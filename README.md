This project contains front-end code(HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for my own resume website.


# License

MIT license is appropriate for this project. This is one of the popular open-source software licenses these days. This project contains front-end code for my resume website. MIT license is a permissive license, which means it only has a few restrictions on the users. It permits everyone to reuse code with no restrictions. As long as people include the original copyright notice and a copy of the license when using this code, I do not mind them using this repository. If people can benefit from this code, I am happy others are using this in commercial applications, modifying or distributing it.
